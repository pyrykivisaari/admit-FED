## Overview

Fluctuational electrodynamics of planar multilayer structures with the help of optical admittances

## Getting started

The python codes require numpy, scipy and matplotlib in order to run. The versions that reportedly work are 2.2.4 for numpy, 3.10.1 for matplotlib, and 1.15.2 for scipy.

There are four example codes in the repository that can be simply run to demonstrate the code:

+ example_gan_led_GF.py
+ example_reflectivity.py
+ example_emission_py
+ example_intracavity_transport.py

Alternatively you can check through the examples by opening or running the Jupyter Notebook file examples.ipynb.

## Credits

The methodology was mostly developed during my Academy of Finland postdoc period in the Engineered Nanosystems Group at Aalto University.
