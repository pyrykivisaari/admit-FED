## Overview

Fluctuational electrodynamics of planar multilayer structures with the help of optical admittances. For more information on the physics, you may check for instance the [optical admittance paper](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-201812216669) or the [intracavity resonances paper](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-202211096478).

## Getting started

The python codes require numpy, scipy and matplotlib in order to run. The versions that reportedly work are 2.2.4 for numpy, 3.10.1 for matplotlib, and 1.15.2 for scipy.

There are four example codes in the repository that can be simply run to demonstrate the code:

+ example_gan_led_GF.py
+ example_reflectivity.py
+ example_emission_py
+ example_intracavity_transport.py

For more documentation on the examples and the code, you may also check through or run the Jupyter Notebook file examples.ipynb.

## Credits

Core parts of the methodology were developed during my Academy of Finland postdoc period in the Engineered Nanosystems Group at Aalto University.
